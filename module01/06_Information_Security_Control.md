# Information Assurance

Information assurance refers to the assurance that the **integrity**, **availability**, **confidentiality**, and **authenticty** of information and information systems is protected during uasage, processing, storage, and transmission of information

Some of the processes that help in achieving information assurance include:

1. Developing local policy, process, and guidance
2. Designing network and user authentication strategy
3. Identifying network vulnerabilities and threats
4. Identifying problems and resource requirements
5. Creating plan for identified resource requirements
6. Applying appropriate information assurance controls
7. Performing certification and accreditation
8. Providing information assurance training

# Threat Modeling

Threat modeling is a **risk assessment approach** for analying security of an application by capturing, organizing, and analyzing all the information that affects the security of an application

1. **Identify security objectives:** Helps to determine how much **effort need to put** on subsequent steps
2. **Application overview:** Identify the **components**, **data flows**, and trust boundaries
3. **Decompose application:** Helps you find more relevant and more **detailed threats**
4. **Identify threats:** Identify threats relevant to your **control** scenario and context using the information obtained in steps 2 and 3
5. **Identify vulnerabilities:** **identify weaknesses** related to the threats found using **vulnerability categories**

# Enterpise Information Security Architecture (EISA)

EISA is a set of requirements, processes, priciples, and models that **determines the structure and behavior of an organization's information systems**

## EISA Goals

1. **Helps in monitoring and dectecting network behaviors** in real time acting upon internal and externals security risks.
2. Helps an organization to **detec and recover from security breeches**.
3. Helps in prioritizing resources of an organization and **pays attention to various threats**
4. **Benefits organization in cost prospective** when incorporated in security provisions such as incident response, disaster recovery, event correlation, etc.
5. Helps in analyziung the procedure needed for the IT department to function properly and **identify assets**.
6. **Helps to perform risk assessment** of an organization IT assets with the cooperation of IT staff.

# Network security zoning

Network security zoning mechanism allows an organiztion **to manage a secure network environment** by selecting the appropriate security levels for different **zones of Internet** and **Intranet networks**.

It helps in effectively monitoring and controlling **inbound and outbound traffic**.

# Information Security Policies

Security policies are the foundation of the **security infrastructure**.

Information security policy defines the basic security requirements and rules to be implemented in order to **protect** and **secure organization's information systems**.

## Goals of Security Policies

- Maintain an outline of the management and administration of network security
- Prevent unauthorized modifications of the data
- Protect an  organization's computing resources
- Reduce risks caused by illegal use of the system resource
- Eliminate legal liabilities arising from employees of third parties
- Differernctiate the user's access rights
- Prevent waste of company's computing resources
- Protect confidential, proprietary information from theft, misuse, unauthorized disclosure

## Types of Security Policies

### Promiscuous policy

**No restrictions** on usage of system resources

### Permissive policy

- Policy begins wide open and only known **dangerous services/attacks or behaviors** are blocked.
- It should be updated regularly to be effective

### Prudent policy

- It provides **maximum security** while allowing known but necessary dangers.
- It **blocks all services** and only safe/necessary services are enabled individually; everything is logged.

### Paranoid policy

It **forbids everything**, no Internet connection, or serverely limited Internet usage.
