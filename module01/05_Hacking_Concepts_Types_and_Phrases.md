# Hacking phases

## Reconnaissance

- Reconnaissance refers to the preparatory phase where an **attacker seeks to gather information** about a target prior to launching an attack

- Could be the future point of return, noted for ease of entry for an attack when more about the **target is known on a board scale**

- Reconnaissance **target range** may include the target organization's clients, employees, operations, network, and systems

### Passive Reconnaissance

- Passive reconnaissance involves acquiring inforamtion **without directly interacting with the target**

- For example, searching public records or news releases

## Active reconnaissance

- Active reconnaissance involves **interacting with the target directly by any means**

- For example, telephone calls to the help desk or technical departments

## Scanning

## Gaining access

## Maintaining access

## Clearing tracks
