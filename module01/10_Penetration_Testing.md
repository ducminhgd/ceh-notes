Penetration testing is a method of evaludating the security of an information system or network by **simulating an attack to find out vulnerabilities** that an attacker could exploit.

**Security measures** are actively analyzed for design weaknesses, technical flaws and vulnerabilities.

A penetration test will not only out vulnerabilites, but will also **document** how the weaknesses can be exploited. 

The result are delivered comprehensively in a report, to executive managements and technical audiences.

# Why Penetration Testing

Identify the threats facing an **organization's information assets**

For testing and validating the efficacy of **security protections and control**

Reduce an organization's expenditure on IT security and enhance **Return On Security Investment** (ROSI) by identifying and remediating vulnerabilities and weaknesses

For changing or updating **existing infrastructure** of software, hardware or network design

Provide assurance with comprehensive **assessment of organization's security** including policy, procedure, design and implementation

Focus on **high-serverity vulnerabilities** and emphasize **application-level security issues** to development teams and management

Gain and maintain certification to an **industry regulation** (BS7799, HIPAA, etc.)

Provide a comprehensive approach of **preparation steps** that can be taken to prevent upcoming exploitation

Adopt **best pratices** in compliance to legal and industry regulations

Evalute the efficacy of **network security devices** such as firewalls, routers, and web servers

# Types of Penetration Testing

## Black-box

**No prior knowledge** of the infrastructure to be tested, maybe blind test or double blind test.

```A blind — or blinded — experiment is an experiment in which information about the test is masked (kept) from the participant, to reduce or eliminate bias, until after a trial outcome is known.[1] It is understood that bias may be intentional or unconscious, thus no dishonesty is implied by blinding. If both tester and subject are blinded, the trial is called a double-blind experiment.```

## White-box

**Complete knowledge** of the infrastructure that needs to be tested

## Grey-box

**Limited knowledge** of the infrastructure that needs to be tested.

# Phases of Penetration Testing

## Pre-attack Phase

- Planning and preparation
- Methodology designing
- Network information gathering

## Attack Phase

- Penetrating perimeter
- Acquiring target
- Escalating privileges
- Execution, implantation, retracting

## Post-attack Phase

- Reporting
- Clean-up
- Artifact destruction
