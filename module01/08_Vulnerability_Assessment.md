# What is Vulnerability Assessment

Vulnerability assessment is an **examination of the ability of a system or application**, include current security procedures and controls, to withstand assault

It recognizes, measures, and classifies security vulnerabilities in a ** computer system**, **network**, and **communication channels**

A vulnerability assessment may be used to:

- **Identify weakness** that could be exploited
- **Predict the effectiveness of additional security measures** in protecting information resources from attack

# Types of Vulnerability Assessment

**Active assessment:** uses a network scanner to find hosts, services, and vulnerabilities

**Passive assessment:** a technique used to sniff the network traffic to find out active systems, network services, applications, and vulnerabilities present

**Host-based assessment:** determines the vulnerabilities in a specific workstation or server

**Internal assessment:** a technique to scan the internal infrastructure to find out the exploits and vulneratibilities

**External assessment:** assesses the network from a hacker's point of view to find out that exploits and vulnerabilities are accessible to the outside world

**Application assessment:** tests the web infrastructure for any misconfiguratyion and known vulnerabilities

**Network assessments:** determines the possible network security attacks that may occur on the organization's system

**Wireless network assessments:** determines the vulnerabilities in organization's wireless networks
