# What is Vulnerability Assessment

Vulnerability assessment is an **examination of the ability of a system or application**, include current security procedures and controls, to withstand assault

It recognizes, measures, and classifies security vulnerabilities in a ** computer system**, **network**, and **communication channels**

A vulnerability assessment may be used to:

- **Identify weakness** that could be exploited
- **Predict the effectiveness of additional security measures** in protecting information resources from attack

# Types of Vulnerability Assessment

**Active assessment:** uses a network scanner to find hosts, services, and vulnerabilities

**Passive assessment:** a technique used to sniff the network traffic to find out active systems, network services, applications, and vulnerabilities present

**Host-based assessment:** determines the vulnerabilities in a specific workstation or server

**Internal assessment:** a technique to scan the internal infrastructure to find out the exploits and vulneratibilities

**External assessment:** assesses the network from a hacker's point of view to find out that exploits and vulnerabilities are accessible to the outside world

**Application assessment:** tests the web infrastructure for any misconfiguratyion and known vulnerabilities

**Network assessments:** determines the possible network security attacks that may occur on the organization's system

**Wireless network assessments:** determines the vulnerabilities in organization's wireless networks

# Network Vulnerability Assessment Methodology

## Phase 1: Acquisition

Collect documents required to:
- Review **laws and procedures** related to network vulnerability assessment
- **Identify and review document related to network security**
- Review the **list of previously discovered vulnerabilities**

## Phase 2: Identification

- Conduct **inteviews with customers and employees** involved in system architecture design, and administration.
- Gather **technical information about all network components**.
- Identify different industry standards which network security systems complies to.

## Phase 3: Analyzing

- Review interviews
- **Analyze the results** of previous vulnerability assessment
- Analyze security vulnerabilities and **identify risks**
- Perform **threat and risk analysis**
- Analyze the effectiveness of **existing security controls**
- Analyze the effectiveness of **existing security policies**

## Phase 4: Evaluation

- Determine the probability of exploitation of **identified vulnerabilities**
- Identify the gaps between **existing and required security measures**
- **Determine the controls** required to mitigate the identified vulnerabilities
- **Identify upgrades** required to the network vulnerability assessment process

## Phase 5: Generating report

- The result of analysis must be presented in a **draft report** to be evaluated for further variations
- **Report should contain**:
    + Task rendered by each team member 
    + Methods used and finding
    + General and specific recommendations
    + Terms used and their definitions
    + Information collected from all the phrases
- All documents must be **stored in a central database** for generating the final report.
